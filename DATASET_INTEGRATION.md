‚úÖ **Local Images Serving** - All images saved as JPG files in `/public/dataset/images/`  
‚úÖ **Live Men's Page** - Browse actual men's fashion items at `/mens`  
‚úÖ **Live Women's Page** - Browse actual women's fashion items at `/womens`  
‚úÖ **API Integration** - Fast server-side filtering and categorization  
‚úÖ **Real Metadata** - Each item includes actual brand names, colors, seasons, usage types

## Performance Notes

- Images are loaded lazily to improve performance
- API responses are cached on the client side
- Skeleton loading states provide smooth user experience
- Responsive design works on all device sizes
- Error handling for failed API requests

## Development

The dataset integration is built using:
- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Radix UI** components
- **Hugging Face Datasets API** for data source

All components are client-side rendered for interactivity while API routes handle server-side data fetching for better performance.
